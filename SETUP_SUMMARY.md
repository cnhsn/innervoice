## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Configure Your API Key
Before using the application, you need to add your OpenRouter API key:

1. Open `.env.local` in the project root
2. Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key
3. Save the file

### 2. Run the Development Server
The server is already running on **http://localhost:3001**

If you need to start it manually:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Application
1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Your name and surname
   - Your date of birth
   - Your current mood (or select "Other" and describe it)
3. Click "Generate My InnerVoice"
4. Wait for the AI to generate your personalized quote and letter
